for the wfc
ill have the user select the amount of rooms they need
all rooms can hold the same number of objects maybe not sure
just create very basic rooms as tiles in blender, with doors at different places/ hallways with multiple doors etc
obviously doors can only connect to other doors so should be easy enough.
last room must not be a hallway

will have to add the prefab game object I made for spawning images into it somehow i guess along each wall or something

have a device to spawn the objects anywhere like a wrist thing or pull up a tablet, then spawn the object and move it at will



tomorrow 
-create the tiles in blender, super basic rooms with just walls and doors 

-write the wfc algorithm, treat it like the 2d top down algorithms

-save the palace object? to a json file using jsonUtility

-write the code in the loadOptionPanel to show what jsons are available

no dead ends until the last room then its an option
archimesh add on

room types:
-hallway, two door on each end, long and narrow
-square room with two doors 
-corner room 
-hallway with 4 doors , front door 



TileData class
number of doors
position of doors

GridCell class
each cell is a possible room
list of all possible TileData options for cell
	will be collapsed to 1 option
user can choose a preset map size (small, medium, large)
2d array of chosen size where each element is a cell with all possibilities 
TileData collapsedTile = "set when coallapsed"

initialize all cells to have all possibilities 

chooses random cell or one with lowest entropy, I guess an edge cell maybe
randomly choose an option for that cell
collapse it

propagate by updating all neighbour cells
remove all incompatible cells 

repeat the selection and propagation until all cells are collapsed

Adjacency rules
	1. Doors must connect
	2. Must be no doors on the edges
	3. etc

Need a isCompatible method to checktwo tiles can link together





need to either do something clever with rotating the tiles i have or just import more tiles,
for example need endtiles that end on more than just a tile with a south door, need ones the end on west, north and east too.
maybe i can add a bias for the end tiles so they are not just always selected.
also maybe should have a miniumum room count and if not met just run the algorithm again until they are 

Also need to modify the propagate method to use a copy of the possible tiles instead of modifying the orginal, then overwrite it 

get this running in unity then create a save method using serialization I think

Write back to Mark

Update the github tracker
