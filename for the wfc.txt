for the wfc
ill have the user select the amount of rooms they need
all rooms can hold the same number of objects maybe not sure
just create very basic rooms as tiles in blender, with doors at different places/ hallways with multiple doors etc
obviously doors can only connect to other doors so should be easy enough.
last room must not be a hallway

will have to add the prefab game object I made for spawning images into it somehow i guess along each wall or something

have a device to spawn the objects anywhere like a wrist thing or pull up a tablet, then spawn the object and move it at will



tomorrow 
-create the tiles in blender, super basic rooms with just walls and doors 

-write the wfc algorithm, treat it like the 2d top down algorithms

-save the palace object? to a json file using jsonUtility

-write the code in the loadOptionPanel to show what jsons are available

no dead ends until the last room then its an option
archimesh add on

room types:
-hallway, two door on each end, long and narrow
-square room with two doors 
-corner room 
-hallway with 4 doors , front door
