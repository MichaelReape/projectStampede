1 define data structure
	- Object for map data
	- Object for the palace map

2 serialization to json
	- JsonUtility API 
	- have a save / load manager
		- saveMap, loadMap, getSavePath

3 save and load to disk
	- have a game controller

		- this can be used from a ui menu


** can maybe just have it save a map for now and extend it later to include the mnemonic devices **

- need a menu system to start the game
	- menu controller

- can maybe encrypt the data or use some cryptography to verify its integrity
