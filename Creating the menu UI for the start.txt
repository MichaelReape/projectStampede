Creating the menu UI for the start of the game

- main menu scene separate to game environment scene


-new map 
	load gameplay scene with a new/empty map. Might prompt the user to create a new palace by size here later

-load map
	bring up list of existing saves/palaces and user can select and continue

after each of these it moves into the gameplay scene

SceneManager.LoadScene() in unity

DONE 
atleast until i can save the map
